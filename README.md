## What is NoOps?

__NoOps = No Uncomfortable Ops__

NoOps stands for "No Uncomfortable Ops".It is the combination of technology, architecture, and activities that enable the elimination of uncomfortable system operations. Designing container-based highly resilient systems, utilizing DevOps, automated monitoring/configuration and eliminating SRE Toil exemplify this approach.
